        <h2 id="about">Hi, my name is Dara. I am a 14 years old boy
             and I am a student at the Liger Leadership Academy. I am
              so happy to study in Liger. Liger is an amazing school
               for me, teachers in Liger are really friendly to us and 
               when we do something wrong the teachers never hurt us by
                using their ability, they just give us ideas or what to do
                 and they try to explain more to make us understand it. One
                  of my favorite subjects is Math. I love to study math than
                   any subjects but just so you know I am not really good at math.
                    For math class, I got four hours a week, Monday one hour, 
                    Tuesday one hour, Thursday one hour and Friday one hour. <a href="http://dara.ligeracademyblog.org/"> CLICK HERE TO EXPLORE MORE</a>
