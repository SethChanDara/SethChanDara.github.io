                Hi, my name is Dara. I am a 14 years old boy and I am a student at the Liger Leadership Academy. I am so happy to study in Liger. Liger is an amazing school for me, teachers in Liger are really friendly to us and when we do something wrong the teachers never hurt us by using their ability, they just give us ideas or what to do and they try to explain more to make us understand it. One of my favorite subjects is Math. I love to study math than any subjects but just so you know I am not really good at math. For math class, I got four hours a week, Monday one hour, Tuesday one hour, Thursday one hour and Friday one hour.

            <b>Electricity:</b>     Welcome to Electricity Exploration. This is round 1 of my year four at Liger Leadership Academy. I am so happy to study and explore about Electricity in Cambodia. In class, we have been researching electricity resources, the costs of it per, how much do we use per year and the imports of electricity from our Cambodia neighboring countries.     Our teacher had divided the whole class into four teams. Each team, have one person working on multimedia, and the rest they do research and find information about the category that the teacher provided. There are four main categories, those are all energy resources, they are: Solar Panels, Hydropower, Thermal, and Windpower.      We went to four different places during the exploration. The first place that we went to was, the Factory Phnom Penh. We listened to the presentation by one of the Energy Lap experts about general information about energy in Cambodia. The second place we went to was, ISPP. We went to see their beautiful solar farm on the top of their tall buildings, asking questions, understand how it works, how much money they spend without solars, and how much money they spent with solars. The third-place that we to was Okra. It was located in Kampong Spue province. We went to a village in a rural area, which only a few families live there, Okra was an organization, which they install free solar panels for the family in some places, they charge money from them, but it just now much. In the last place, we went back to the Factory Phnom Penh, which we listen to a presentation from an expert from the Blue Circle, it was about the wind turbine. We had asked them a lot of questions about wind power, their visions and their projects in Cambodia.
